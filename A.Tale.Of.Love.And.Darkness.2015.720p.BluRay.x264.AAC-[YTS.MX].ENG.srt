1
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,373
Go to sleep.

2
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,974
I'm not tired.

3
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,644
All right.

4
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,581
Let's make up a story.

5
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,683
Shall I start?
Yes.

6
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,389
Once upon a time
there was a village,

7
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,990
abandoned
by its inhabitants...

8
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,261
Even the rats left.

9
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,198
Even the rats left.

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,168
The village stood silent
and abandoned, year after year.

11
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,438
<i> Rain pounded the streets,</i>

12
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,075
<i> washing away any human trace.</i>

13
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:55,581
<i> When the rats cleared,</i>
<i>birds swarmed over the village.</i>

14
00:01:55,583 --> 00:02:00,219
<i> There were so many, they</i>
<i> almost blocked out the sky.</i>

15
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,621
<i> It was night, all day long.</i>

16
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,459
<i> But then,</i>
<i> from one small house...</i>

17
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,762
<i> A little boy opened the door.</i>

18
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:15,134
<i> He was the only one</i>
<i> left behind.</i>

19
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,820
<i>My mother was 38 when she died.</i>

20
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,426
<i> At my age today,</i>
<i> I could be her father.</i>

21
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,265
<i> Many things have happened</i>
<i> in Jerusalem.</i>

22
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,134
<i> The city was</i>
<i> destroyed, rebuilt,</i>

23
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,837
<i> destroyed and rebuilt again.</i>

24
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,641
<i> Conqueror after conqueror</i>
<i> came, ruled for a while,</i>

25
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,610
<i> left behind some walls,</i>
<i> some towers,</i>

26
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,146
<i> some cracks in the stones,</i>

27
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,781
<i> and then disappeared,</i>

28
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,851
<i> like the morning mist</i>
<i> down the hillslopes.</i>

29
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:11,623
<i> Jerusalem's a black widow,</i>

30
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,860
<i> who devours her lovers while</i>
<i> they are still inside her.</i>

31
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,203
We're late.
The boy, arieh.

32
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,149
<i> My mother grew up</i>
<i> in the town of rovno,</i>

33
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,319
<i> which was then in Poland,</i>
<i> and is now in Ukraine.</i>

34
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,557
<i> Her childhood there</i>
<i> was made up of words like...</i>

35
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,827
<i> Chandeliers, servants,</i>

36
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,563
<i> mystery,</i>

37
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,899
<i> romantic melancholy...</i>

38
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,906
<i> As anti-semitism spread</i>
<i> through Europe...</i>

39
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,910
<i> My mother</i>
<i> dreamed of Israel...</i>

40
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,181
<i> As the land</i>
<i> of milk and honey,</i>

41
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,316
<i> where pioneers</i>
<i> made the desert bloom...</i>

42
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,461
<i> She imagined the pioneer as</i>
<i> a poet, worker, revolutionary,</i>

43
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:26,565
<i> born for fields</i>
<i> and battlefields alike,</i>

44
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:32,204
<i> but also emotional</i>
<i> and intellectual.</i>

45
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,578
<i> After my mother</i>
<i> and her family fled Europe,</i>

46
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,214
<i> back in Poland's</i>
<i> sosenki forest,</i>

47
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,449
<i> where my mother</i>
<i> and her sisters</i>

48
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,719
<i> once loved to pick</i>
<i> mushrooms and berries,</i>

49
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,821
<i> and sleep</i>
<i> in sleeping bags</i>

50
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,957
<i> on the riverbank</i>
<i> beneath the stars.</i>

51
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,396
<i> Germans, Lithuanians,</i>
<i> and Ukrainians,</i>

52
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,930
<i> opened fire</i>
<i> with machine guns,</i>

53
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:03,468
<i> and killed 23,000 Jews</i>
<i> in two days.</i>

54
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,677
<i> They killed almost everyone</i>
<i> my mother had ever known.</i>

55
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,921
A million kiddies...

56
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,491
A million kiddies...

57
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,561
They killed a million kids
like you!

58
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,701
Jerusalem, 1945,
under the British mandate

59
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,307
good day, ma'am.
May I please have Tel Aviv 648?

60
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,277
<i> Please wait a minute, sir.</i>

61
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,379
<i> Mr. nashashibi is on the way.</i>

62
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,715
Of course I'll wait,
but people are waiting

63
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,316
on the other end too.

64
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,851
It's too early, arieh.

65
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,653
It will take time
to get a connection.

66
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,288
What if they connect us
right way,

67
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,756
and nobody is there yet?

68
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,525
Hello? Tsvi?

69
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,464
<i> Speaking. </i>
It's arieh, from Jerusalem.

70
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,300
<i> Yes, arieh. Hello.</i>
<i> This is tsvi. How are you?</i>

71
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,001
Everything is fine here.

72
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,738
We're calling
from the pharmacy.
Ask my sister how she is.

73
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,474
<i> How's it going in Tel Aviv?</i>

74
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,743
Everything's fine.
Nothing special.

75
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,411
Life.

76
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,981
No news is good news.
There's no news here either.

77
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,685
<i> We'll write and set a time</i>
<i> for the next call.</i>

78
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,487
<i> Take care of yourselves.</i>

79
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,921
<i> Be well. </i>
You too.

80
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,062
<i> They weren't actually sure</i>
<i> if they'd talk again or not.</i>

81
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,332
<i> There could be riots,</i>
<i> or a pogrom.</i>

82
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,334
<i> The British could betray us.</i>

83
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,071
The curfew will start soon.

84
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,349
Hello.

85
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,084
Good evening.
Good evening.

86
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,523
<i> Close the windows!</i>
<i> Close the doors, please.</i>

87
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,929
They're all gone now.

88
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,766
It's like rovno
was just a dream.

89
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,813
It's here.

90
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,821
A new book,
hot off the press.

91
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,758
My first book.

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,429
The novella
in Hebrew literature.

93
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,931
It's like having a new baby.

94
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,741
I'll invite your parents.

95
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,548
"To my brother
and teacher, David,

96
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,450
whom I lost
in the darkness."

97
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,155
Who said your uncle
would be

98
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,491
the only important
academic in the family?

99
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,994
Well, it's only
my first publication.

100
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:27,699
And not the last.

101
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,236
The borscht is good.
Not bad...

102
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,505
Almost tasty.

103
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,508
But even gentile servants
in Jewish homes

104
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,579
knew that borscht should be
sour and just slightly sweet--

105
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,682
never sweet and slightly sour.

106
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:48,853
Like the poles who always add
sugar, with no rhyme or reason.

107
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,924
They even ruin horseradish
by adding jam to it.

108
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,730
Let's raise a toast
in honor of the new book.

109
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,131
Lehayim.
Congratulations.

110
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,882
If you have to choose
between telling a lie
or insulting someone,

111
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:18,984
choose to be generous.

112
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,123
I'm allowed to lie?

113
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,561
Sometimes... yes.

114
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,733
It's better to be sensitive
than to be honest.

115
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,322
Come, hold the peg.

116
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,959
We'll make
our own little kibbutz,

117
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,995
and by our own efforts, "bring
forth bread from the earth."

118
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,163
Forward!

119
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,337
You know, the word
"kadima" means forward.

120
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,106
But...

121
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:21,112
The word actually derives
from the word "kedem,"

122
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,782
which refers to
"ancient times." Ahh!

123
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,651
Ah!

124
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:31,122
So the Hebrew speaker actually
looks forward to the past.

125
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,625
Interesting, isn't it?
Yes.

126
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,161
Are you hurt?

127
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,730
Arieh?

128
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,366
Can you recognize me
under all this sweat?

129
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,034
Watch this.

130
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,737
Ha!

131
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,387
That's it!

132
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,028
<i> My father once told me,</i>

133
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,998
<i> "Amos, consider</i>
<i> the etymological link</i>
<i> between the words...</i>

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,168
<i> Earth, man,</i>

135
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,240
<i> blood, red, silence."</i>

136
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,720
You write a new novel
every six months,

137
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,957
and right away, all the pretty
girls grab you off the shelf

138
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,259
and take you
straight to bed.

139
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,695
At least my books
have some fun.

140
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,030
If you're trying to get girls,

141
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,767
maybe you should write
romance novels.

142
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,816
All I'm saying is,
don't rush.

143
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,417
Ask your sisters.

144
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,954
Your life is only your own
for a very short time--

145
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,323
from the time you leave home
to your first pregnancy.

146
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,759
Even when your child grows up,
you don't get your life back.

147
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,961
You go from being a mother
to a grandmother.

148
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,932
But everybody says
that children

149
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,234
are the best thing
that can happen to you.

150
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,070
Who's everybody?

151
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,940
Remember what happened
to our neighbor?

152
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,275
Ira?

153
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,744
Steletsky's wife.

154
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,779
Yes, the alcoholic husband,

155
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,916
who ran
our father's flour mill.

156
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:47,292
<i> He would bet on her</i>
<i> at cards, and lose her,</i>

157
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,928
<i> each time for one night,</i>

158
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,765
<i> until finally she left him</i>
<i> for the coachman's son.</i>

159
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,367
Anton!

160
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,469
<i> From this hut...</i>

161
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,506
<i> She could see her children</i>
<i> playing in the distance.</i>

162
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,846
<i> Then one day, she decided</i>
<i> to go see her daughter.</i>

163
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,056
<i> As she approached,</i>

164
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,490
<i> her daughter</i>
<i> called her a whore...</i>

165
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,893
<i> And refused to speak to her.</i>

166
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,262
Kira!

167
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:32,203
<i> That night, ira gathered</i>
<i>whatever strength she had left,</i>

168
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,473
<i> went into the little hut</i>
<i> with a can of petrol...</i>

169
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,381
<i> And lit a match.</i>

170
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,212
Our children don't realize
how much they can hurt us.

171
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,847
I just can't
understand why...

172
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,849
Why no one warned you?

173
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,084
What did you expect?
A warning in fine print?

174
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,955
That you're only food?

175
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,591
That you're what the chick
eats to grow strong?

176
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,862
No one warns us,

177
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:35,066
because every mother
thinks she's the only one
who feels that way--

178
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,569
and every mother cries
into her pillow, alone at night.

179
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,206
Except for our mother,
who just curses us.

180
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,115
"Tarzan the invincible"

181
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,400
stay out of trouble.
Just be a good boy, okay?

182
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,468
Okay.

183
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,908
<i>My parents' friends,</i>
<i> staszek and mala rudnicki,</i>

184
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,344
<i> had no children of their own,</i>

185
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:23,414
<i> so sometimes my parents</i>
<i> would let them borrow me.</i>

186
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,483
<i> My father said</i>

187
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,654
<i> that the Hebrew word</i>
<i> for childlessness</i>

188
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,358
<i> is related</i>
<i> to the word for darkness,</i>

189
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,261
<i> and that the word for darkness</i>
<i> is related to forgetting.</i>

190
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,999
<i> Lack of memory.</i>

191
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,002
<i> Lack of children.</i>

192
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,104
<i> Lack of light.</i>

193
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,542
<i> My mother would</i>
<i> go off on her own.</i>

194
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:56,047
<i> To where,</i>
<i> I could only imagine.</i>

195
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,950
When visiting an arab home,

196
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,119
it's especially important
to remember your manners.

197
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:06,457
Children are expected to stay
out of adult conversations.

198
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,960
Only if spoken to directly,

199
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:12,463
may you answer briefly
and very politely.

200
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,532
If refreshments are served,

201
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,069
don't choose something that
might make crumbs or grip.

202
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,038
If they still insist
you have something,

203
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,974
just refuse, but delicately,
like a gentleman--

204
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,711
even if you can't resist
the sight of sweets.

205
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,980
We were only invited
because your uncle staszek

206
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,581
took care
of al-halwani's son.

207
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,718
If, on this occasion,
in such tense times,

208
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,189
we behave like animals,
not only will it be
sheer insolence,

209
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,326
it could cause enormous
damage to the future
of our two peoples.

210
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,438
Jacket? Jacket?

211
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:36,047
Ah! Ah, my friend,
come, come, come.

212
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,548
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

213
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,284
Pleased to meet you,
madam.
Hello.

214
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,321
Please, everybody, I would
like you to meet my friend,

215
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,223
the great Mr. stav.

216
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,059
Mr. stav helped to clear
my son Edward,

217
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:51,062
from that unfortunate incident
at the beginning of the summer.

218
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:54,499
Thank you for coming.
Please, come here.

219
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:59,470
Maybe the youngster
would like to go and
play in the garden?

220
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,408
Please.
Please, madam.

221
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,477
I want to show you...

222
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,082
Good morning, miss.

223
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,688
My name is Amos. And you?

224
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,292
My name is Aisha.

225
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,297
This is my brother, awwad.

226
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,400
Your father...

227
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,635
Your honored father
suggested...

228
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,704
That I come here
to play with you.

229
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,207
He's not my father.
He's my mother's uncle.

230
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,243
I don't live here.
I live in talbieh.

231
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:15,213
How do you
know Hebrew?

232
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,516
I've been studying piano
in rehavia for three years now.

233
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,752
It's a beautiful language,
and rehavia is beautiful too,

234
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,888
so well-kept and quiet.

235
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,793
Talbieh is also
well-kept and quiet.

236
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,166
Would you mind if
we talked for a bit?

237
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,802
Aren't we talking
already?

238
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,185
There's enough room in
this country for both peoples.

239
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:58,522
We just need to learn
to live together in peace
and mutual respect.

240
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,395
I have a big brother
in London.

241
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,764
He's studying
to be a lawyer.

242
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,935
What do you want to study
when you grow up?

243
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,273
What about you?

244
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:19,210
You'll be a lawyer too,
based on how you speak.

245
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,912
What makes you think that?

246
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,315
I'm going to write a book.

247
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,584
Really?
What kind of book?

248
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,586
Poems.

249
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:33,591
Poems?
Yes. In French
and English.

250
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:38,462
I also write in arabic, but
i never show it to anyone.

251
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,967
Is there
nice Hebrew poetry?

252
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:46,237
Of course!
Levin kipnis, Rachel.

253
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:50,574
Vladimir jabotinsky,
tcheminchowsky...

254
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,344
"A generation of gods
walks the land...

255
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,615
"A generation
drunk on life!

256
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,418
"Estranged from
a sick people.

257
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,421
And the tribe of sufferers."

258
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,596
Can you also climb trees?

259
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,607
Rest a minute,

260
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,444
just a minute.

261
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:29,280
Rest a minute,

262
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,715
just a minute.

263
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,782
This is the father of Amos.
May I please speak
with Mr. al-halwani?

264
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:18,422
Well, could you please
tell him how very truly sorry
we are about what happened?

265
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,392
We are anxious for
the health of the dear child.

266
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:24,428
We'll pay any of the child's
medical expenses,
of course, in full.

267
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,135
And we sincerely wish to effect
a meeting at an early date

268
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,805
to clarify and try
to right the wrong.

269
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,023
Once there were two monks...

270
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,092
Who imposed all sorts of
restrictions on themselves.

271
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,760
Among other things,

272
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:02,166
they resolve to cross
all of India on foot.

273
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,675
<i> They also took a vow</i>
<i> of complete silence.</i>

274
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,679
<i> Even in their sleep,</i>
<i> they would not speak</i>

275
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:20,017
<i> a single word throughout</i>
<i> their years of travel.</i>

276
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,819
But once...

277
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,555
While they were walking
along the bank of a river,

278
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:27,791
they heard a drowning woman
crying for help.

279
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,538
<i> Without a word, the younger</i>
<i> monk jumped into the water.</i>

280
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,676
<i> He bore the woman</i>
<i> on his back</i>

281
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,978
<i> and laid her on the ground.</i>

282
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:58,656
<i> The two monks continued</i>
<i> their journey in silence.</i>

283
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,524
Six months later,

284
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:03,160
the younger monk
suddenly asked,

285
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,899
"tell me...

286
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:16,106
Do you think
i sinned when I carried
that woman on my back?"

287
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,776
<i> His friend answered</i>
<i> with a question:</i>

288
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,013
"What? Are you still
carrying her on your back?"

289
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:44,201
Amos, when I was a student,
i loved to read here
among the flowers.

290
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,272
And one day, after class,
she met your future father here.

291
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,674
Do you remember what I told you
about the word "flower"?

292
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,279
Flower is a combination of
the words "bull" and "scent."

293
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,548
"Bull" has the same root
as "fertility,"

294
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,885
and "scent" lures the insects
that fertilize the plant.

295
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:05,055
He took advantage of
my weakness for words.

296
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,225
What could I do? All
the boys were courting her!

297
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,294
I had to make myself
stand out.

298
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,896
That's what happened.

299
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:18,128
<i> Remembering is like trying</i>
<i> to restore an old building</i>

300
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,364
<i> with the stones</i>
<i> from its ruins.</i>

301
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,368
<i> And the stones have memory.</i>

302
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,646
May I please have some apc?

303
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,815
I have a headache
that won't go away.

304
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:41,318
I don't believe them.
I don't believe anyone anymore.

305
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,921
It's a big conspiracy.

306
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:47,658
What do you think?
That our boys will
fight for you,

307
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,827
that they risk their
young lives for you,

308
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,162
when you say
it's all a conspiracy?

309
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,031
Yes, because it is
all one big conspiracy!

310
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,833
It's like theater!

311
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:59,670
Ben-gurion secretly
agreed to sell Jerusalem
to king Abdullah

312
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:01,672
so that he can keep
his kibbutzim.

313
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,341
They don't care if they
slaughter and burn us all.

314
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,910
What's wrong with you?
How can you say that?

315
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,848
A million kids...

316
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,119
If there is a war--
when there is a war--
we will win.

317
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,020
Our state is standing
right at the gate.

318
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,125
It's not standing.
There is no gate.

319
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,963
There is an abyss.
Not in front of the child.

320
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,104
Mm.

321
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,708
Nothing grew!

322
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,943
Come here.

323
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,787
You know...

324
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,224
That if you open up
someone's head and
take out his brain...

325
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,730
You see that our brains are
nothing but cauliflower--

326
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:02,332
a cauliflower this size.

327
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:06,737
What a miracle it is that
this small cauliflower

328
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:10,174
can hold the sky
and the land,

329
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,277
the sun and
all the stars.

330
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,749
It can hold Plato's ideas,
and Beethoven's music,

331
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:22,753
and Chekhov's plays,

332
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:26,990
all the dinosaurs
and the whales...

333
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,331
And the hopes
and the passions and
mistakes and fantasies...

334
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,868
And that's it.

335
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,450
Amos!

336
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,385
Come play with us!

337
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,422
I can't. My grandma
is coming today.

338
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,262
Kids! What are you doing?

339
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,803
You've abandoned me.

340
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:15,806
I have no life here.

341
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:19,376
You spit on me,
your own mother--

342
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:24,081
the only person
who will take care of you!

343
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,418
Just look at you.

344
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,754
How can you stand it?

345
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,426
This place is disgusting!

346
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,499
Oh. I'm not good enough
for you to answer?

347
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,404
I should have
left you in rovno!

348
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,407
I would have been
better off!

349
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,169
Fanitchka!

350
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,007
Fania!

351
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,111
Amos, where's your mother?

352
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,953
Fania?

353
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,411
You won't believe it!
My book is sold out!

354
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,180
All five of them!

355
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,649
He said he'd order more.
He already did, by phone.

356
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,052
Five more! He says this
is just the beginning!

357
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,663
Let's go to the Edison
and see a film.

358
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,937
Zarchi will
watch you, okay?

359
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:28,672
For us.

360
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:33,510
<i> You can find hell</i>
<i> and paradise in every room.</i>

361
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,384
<i> A little meanness,</i>
<i> and people are</i>
<i> hell to each other.</i>

362
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:43,520
<i> A little compassion,</i>
<i> a little generosity,</i>

363
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,623
<i> and people find</i>
<i> paradise in each other.</i>

364
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:50,127
Congratulations again.

365
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,562
I still can't believe it.

366
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,197
Give my love to garbo.

367
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,134
Amos, behave yourself.

368
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,636
Want a book?

369
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,015
Tchernichowsky.

370
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,728
<i> It seems that your Patience</i>
<i> has helped our plants.</i>

371
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,164
Why don't you go
see for yourself?

372
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,802
When my family moved to
the house on dubinska street,

373
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:16,373
we inherited some tenants
from the previous owners.

374
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,379
A Polish officer named jan
lived in the front room.

375
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:26,349
<i> Every Friday, my mother</i>
<i> would send one of us</i>

376
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:30,620
<i> with a tray of hot biscuits,</i>
<i> straight from the oven,</i>

377
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,557
<i> to wish him a good sabbath</i>
<i>on behalf of the entire family.</i>

378
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,824
<i> Sabbat shalom.</i>

379
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:40,397
<i> He would stroke my head...</i>

380
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,499
Call me<i> cyganka,</i>

381
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,868
a gypsy.

382
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,572
<i> And promise he would</i>
<i> wait for me</i>

383
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:51,441
<i> and marry me when I grew up.</i>

384
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,255
<i> But, one day...</i>

385
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:11,294
<i> A Sunday morning</i>
<i> before the sun came up...</i>

386
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,599
<i> The colonel decided</i>
<i> to try out his pistol.</i>

387
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,238
<i> He fired two bullets </i>
<i> through the closed window</i>
<i> into the garden.</i>

388
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:26,543
<i> By chance, he hit a pigeon</i>

389
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:29,412
<i> which was found wounded</i>
<i> in the garden the next day.</i>

390
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,818
Then he fired one shot
at a bottle on the table...

391
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,922
<i> Two more at the chandelier...</i>

392
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,160
And then...

393
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:05,548
Once, I found a note
in a crack in a desk drawer.

394
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,218
It was written
in a woman's handwriting.

395
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,256
"To my precious
little wolf cub.

396
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:17,227
"In all my life I've
never met a better, more
generous man than you.

397
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:21,398
<i> I am not worthy to kiss</i>
<i> the soles of your shoes."</i>

398
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,535
There were two
spelling mistakes.

399
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,506
It was signed with an n,

400
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,975
and she sketched lips below it.

401
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,488
Nobody knows anything
about anyone...

402
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,427
Not even
the person you marry,

403
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:52,329
and not even
about ourselves.

404
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,832
We know nothing.

405
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,669
But if we sometimes imagine
that we do know something,

406
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,472
that's even worse.

407
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:05,442
It's better to live
without knowing

408
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,278
than to live in error.

409
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,488
November 29, 1947

410
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,290
tonight...

411
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,292
At lake success, near New York,

412
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:26,496
the general assembly of
the un will vote on what?

413
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:29,299
Adopting the unscop proposal.

414
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:30,800
And what's the proposal?

415
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:34,671
To create two states
out of the British mandate:

416
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,639
One Jewish, and one arab.

417
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:41,978
Who opposes it?
The Muslim bloc and britain.

418
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,481
And why?

419
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:48,651
They want an arab state
under British protection.

420
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,720
Like Egypt,
transjordan and Iraq.

421
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,722
Well done!

422
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,892
You know, the name
lake success...

423
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,695
Is the opposite
of the sea of tears,

424
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,531
with symbolized the fate of
our people for the poet bialik.

425
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,403
It's interesting.
Interesting.

474
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,814
in my school in vilna.

475
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:46,889
Then, when my father,
your grandfather, came
to the school to complain,

476
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,725
they attacked him too.

477
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:52,061
They threw him
to the ground,

478
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:55,298
and removed his pants
in the middle of the yard.

479
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:00,136
All the children laughed.

480
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,072
And the teachers watched
and were silent.

481
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,844
Some of them also laughed.

482
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,950
Bullies may well
bully you someday

483
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:17,320
in the street
or at school.

484
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,556
They may do it just because
you're a bit like me.

485
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,595
But from now on,
now that we have
our own state,

486
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:28,765
you will never be bullied
just because you are a Jew.

487
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,833
Never again.

488
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:45,715
<i> A few hours later,</i>
<i> at seven in the morning,</i>

489
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:48,151
<i> while we were all asleep,</i>

490
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:52,789
<i> shots were fired on</i>
<i> Jewish vehicles in Jerusalem,</i>

491
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:56,025
<i> which turned into riots</i>
<i> across the country.</i>

492
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,120
My code name
is garibaldi.

493
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,992
I'll be instructing
you how to help

494
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,061
in our patriotic
wartime efforts.

495
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,264
You will help...

496
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,868
You will search all
the storage yards and sheds

497
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,671
for empty bags
to fill with sand,

498
00:45:41,673 --> 00:45:43,906
and empty bottles
to make "cocktails"

499
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,176
that will be very tasty
for the enemy.

500
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:51,948
You also will
gather edible Greens
from empty fields,

501
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,350
to help relieve
the hunger in Jerusalem.

502
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:56,085
And we'll also serve
as look-outs...

503
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:00,022
To observe any movements
by the brits.

504
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:01,691
Now go!

505
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,053
How beautiful.

506
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:33,723
Wash them off
and I'll cook them
right now.

507
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:35,892
You must be hungry
after all your food foraging.

508
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,797
Put some water in this.

509
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,809
Fanitchka?

510
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,977
I joined the national guard.

511
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,919
Don't you have anything
to say about that?

512
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,688
What do you want me to say?

513
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,024
Congratulations.
You're very brave.

514
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,999
<i> The war infiltrated our home.</i>

515
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:20,803
<i> Life became</i>
<i> rations, sandbags,</i>

516
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,905
<i> mourning.</i>

517
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,805
<i> In the lives of individuals,</i>

518
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:57,807
<i> and in the lives of nations,</i>

519
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:03,279
<i> the worst conflicts erupt</i>
<i> between two persecuted people.</i>

520
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:13,155
<i> Only in the imagination</i>
<i> do the persecuted</i>
<i> unite in solidarity</i>

521
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:16,292
<i> to fight together against</i>
<i> their ruthless oppressor.</i>

522
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,830
<i> In reality,</i>

523
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:23,332
<i> two children of</i>
<i> the same abusive father</i>

524
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,935
<i> will not necessarily</i>
<i> become allies.</i>

525
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,540
<i> Often, each sees</i>
<i> in his brother</i>

526
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:34,577
<i> their father's</i>
<i> threatening ways.</i>

527
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,486
<i> Europe abused the arabs,</i>
<i> humiliating them</i>
<i> with colonialism...</i>

528
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,824
<i> And the same Europe persecuted</i>
<i> and annihilated the Jews.</i>

529
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,867
<i> But the arabs see us</i>
<i> as an arrogant new branch</i>

530
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,036
<i> of European colonialism</i>
<i> and exploitation,</i>

531
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:07,109
<i> and we do not see arabs</i>
<i> as brothers in adversity,</i>

532
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:12,615
<i> but rather, as anti-semites,</i>
<i> Nazis in disguise.</i>

533
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:21,057
<i> ...after 30 years</i>
<i> of the British mandate...</i>

534
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,393
<i> The new state was born</i>

535
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:29,565
<i> with David Ben-gurion's</i>
<i> declaration in Tel Aviv</i>
<i> just hours earlier.</i>

536
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:33,235
<i> For weeks, our</i>
<i> basement apartment was turned</i>
<i> into a kind of bomb shelter</i>

537
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:36,138
<i> for the residents</i>
<i> of the apartments above us.</i>

538
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,083
You're pulling. It hurts!

539
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,952
What is this?
Crumbs everywhere!

540
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:52,888
You can't make
such a mess here!

541
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,327
A hundred Jews were burned alive
yesterday near sheikh Jarrah.

542
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,263
They were in a convoy
going up to the hospital
and university.

543
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,032
A hundred people!

544
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:06,102
Doctors, nurses, students.

545
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:09,972
-Why didn't we save them?
-The British wouldn't let us.

546
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,507
Who can even stomach
this chicken,

547
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,543
when horrors like that
happen right in front of us?

548
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,013
The children haven't
eaten meat in two months.

549
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,933
Here you go, ma'am.

550
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,375
Who's next?

551
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,392
<i> When her friend died,</i>

552
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:15,464
<i> when real tragedy</i>
<i> landed outside the pages</i>
<i> of my mother's novels,</i>

553
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:20,069
<i> the suffering</i>
<i> wasn't romantic at all.</i>

554
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,605
There's an armistice
agreement with Egypt.

555
00:52:56,607 --> 00:53:01,343
Next will be transjordan,
and then Syria and Lebanon.

556
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,558
<i> When the British left,</i>

557
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,361
<i> the green line was drawn</i>
<i> around Israel.</i>

558
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,633
<i> Our neighbors moved back</i>
<i> to their own homes,</i>

559
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,802
<i> euphoric and optimistic,</i>

560
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:31,540
<i> and left us along</i>
<i> to ourselves.</i>

561
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:36,178
<i> The improbable creation</i>
<i> of the new state of Israel</i>

562
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,317
<i> extinguished thousands</i>
<i> of years of Jewish longing</i>

563
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:44,353
<i> for a homeland of its own.</i>

564
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:49,258
<i> Maybe my mother felt the loss</i>
<i> of this passion, this dream,</i>

565
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,896
<i> because suddenly she stopped</i>
<i> telling her stories.</i>

566
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,869
What do my eyes see?

567
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:37,873
A boy, about three, standing
in the middle of the street,

568
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,776
and a military vehicle
rushing toward him.

569
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,745
I mustered all my strength.

570
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,214
I yelled to him.

571
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:47,716
"Boy! Boy!"

572
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:51,387
It seemed
my shout reached him,

573
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,789
because he quickly
jumped aside.

574
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:57,393
Who knows? Maybe
his mother left him alone,

575
00:54:57,395 --> 00:55:00,462
or maybe she's poor
and can't support him--

576
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,965
and can't stand
to see him starve,

577
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:05,467
or maybe he's an orphan.

578
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,971
Yes, there are children
like that in our world too.

579
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,576
Give me your sandwich!

580
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:50,846
Give me your sandwich!

581
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:33,322
Our blood will not
be spilled in vain!

582
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:36,458
Abandoned property

583
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,523
I'll be back
in fifteen minutes.

584
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:09,858
Can I go with you?

585
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,462
I need to be
alone for a bit.

586
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:15,631
You can be alone too.

587
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,766
I'll be back soon.

588
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,980
Maybe you can
finally tell me.

589
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:15,984
What is it about you that
makes me love you so much?

590
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,155
More than anything...

591
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:23,926
More than anything,
i love your innocence.

592
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:25,661
I've never encountered
anything like it.

593
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,831
Even after you live out
your entire life,

594
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,867
and have all kinds
of experiences,

595
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:35,904
your innocence
will never abandon you.

596
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:44,246
I think you'll grow up
to be a man...

597
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:47,683
Who is open and enthusiastic
like your father,

598
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:53,021
but you'll also be a man who's
quiet and closed and full...

599
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,257
Like a well
in a deserted village.

600
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,194
You can be both.

601
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:18,547
<i> I felt a terrible dread</i>
<i> as if on the distant horizon,</i>

602
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:21,183
<i> a vague disaster</i>
<i> was taking shape.</i>

603
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:30,225
<i> My mother started having</i>
<i> frequent headaches.</i>

604
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:34,129
<i> Her migraines</i>
<i> gave her insomnia.</i>

605
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:55,917
<i> The doctor prescribed</i>
<i>sleeping pills and sedatives...</i>

606
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,655
<i> But nothing helped.</i>

607
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,872
Please don't be
angry with me, Amos.

608
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:19,274
It's a little hard
for me right now.

609
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:22,678
You see how much I'm trying
to make things right.

610
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,355
Thank you, Amos.

611
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:35,791
I know I can rely
on you completely.

612
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,895
-Good night.
-Good night.

613
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,309
Papa?

614
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:57,279
Sleep... sleep.

615
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,787
I'm so lucky.
I'm so lucky.

616
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,767
<i> It's 7:00, and these</i>
<i> are the headlines.</i>

617
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,903
<i> This year too, there is</i>
<i> an urgent need to find homes</i>

618
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:59,908
<i> for innocent children</i>
<i> with foster families</i>
<i> across the country.</i>

619
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:05,447
<i> Last year alone,</i>
<i> 50,000 children were</i>
<i> placed in homes.</i>

620
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:10,051
<i>Despite this achievement, there</i>
<i> are still 20,000 children,</i>

621
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:14,055
<i> who will have to spend</i>
<i> the winter months in tents.</i>

622

<i> 10,000 children ages 5-12,</i>

01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:32,474
<i> to host a child</i>
<i> from the camps...</i>

627
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,835
She's punishing herself.

628
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:02,337
Just to punish me.

629
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,108
I have done.

630
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,476
I have done.

631
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:12,781
I have been doing.
I have been doing.

632
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:15,317
I should have done.

633
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:19,955
I should have done.
I should have been doing.

634
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,404
Go...

635
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,975
Go play a little outside.

636
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,182
But be careful.

637
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:23,018
There are
all sorts out there.

638
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,921
Not all women are as kind
and honest as you are.

639
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:40,201
You can come home
whenever you like.

640
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,612
Do you need anything?

641
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:51,846
Amos is here.

642
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:16,531
<i> My father and I told people</i>
<i> that she had the flu</i>

643
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,967
<i> or a particular</i>
<i> sensitivity to sunlight,</i>

644
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:22,137
<i> or that she gets</i>
<i> very tired.</i>

645
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:26,307
<i> We didn't tell anyone</i>
<i> what we both knew.</i>

646
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,977
<i> The only one who knew</i>
<i> was my mother's best friend.</i>

647
01:07:28,979 --> 01:07:30,678
Amos.

648
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,981
You're a ray of sunshine,
you know?

649
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:35,583
Your mother says that
you're her light.

650
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,367
You're such a clever,
sensitive child.

651
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:56,271
You know,
i have a feeling...

652
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:59,741
That when you grow up
you will be a writer.

653
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,710
I won't be a writer.

654
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,046
I'm not sensitive!

655
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:09,350
I'll be a farmer
or a dog-poisoner with
a syringe full of poison.

656
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:15,557
Have a good day.
You too...

657
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:36,244
Do you know what
happened when Tarzan met
the cowboys and Indians?

658
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:38,613
What happened?

659
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:43,218
Tarzan watched
from a tree as the cowboys
and Indians fought below.

660
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,556
A cowboy caught a snake
by the throat

661
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:51,559
and poured its venom
into the Indian's mouth!

662
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:55,163
So the Indian grabbed
a thorny cactus

663
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:58,066
and stabbed...

664
01:08:58,068 --> 01:09:00,235
The cowboy in his blue eyes.

665
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:03,138
Tarzan watched from above

666
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:07,308
and thought
about what to do.

667
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,346
And then what?

668
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,116
I'll tell you tomorrow.

669
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,557
The story was great.
Where did you hear it?

670
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,595
Hey-- isn't
that your dad?

671
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,831
Where?

672
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,752
Ah!

673
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:49,237
Amos... you're being
very good.

674
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:51,739
Your mother has
a terrible headache.

675
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,908
Keep your voice down.

676
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:57,245
And no running
around, okay?

677
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:58,246
Get the door.

678
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:15,763
- Do you need anything?
- No, thank you.

679
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:17,265
Then why don't you lie down?

680
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:21,002
I'm fine
like this, thank you.

681
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,604
Do you see a doctor?
I don't need a doctor.

682
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:25,940
Mother, leave her alone.
Don't interfere, arieh.

683
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:29,277
She's being so dramatic,
as if she deserves the moon.

684
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,347
So what? Moods.
Melancholia.

685
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:34,849
It just shows that her
heart is still young.

686
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,285
As if she's the only one
having a hard time here!

687
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:40,021
That the rest of us
are living in luxury!

688
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:05,373
<i>Behold, I call heaven and earth</i>
<i> today to bear witness</i>

689
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:08,075
<i> that I have set before you</i>
<i> life and death,</i>

690
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:11,112
the blessing and the curse.

691
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,581
Therefore choose life,

692
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:17,885
so that you and your
descendants may live.

693
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,555
Did you finish your homework?

694
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,594
Fania?

695
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,431
How did you sleep?

696
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:05,867
Well, I finally
slept well.

697
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:10,438
The new pills
must be working.

698
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,173
I had so many dreams.

699
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:18,679
One was about someone I hadn't
thought about in years.

700
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,649
In rovno, there was
a rich fur trader

701
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:24,785
who even got
orders from Paris,

702
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:29,123
because he had a rare type
of fur, the silver fox.

703
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:33,427
Furs that sparkled like
frost in the moonlight.

704
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:36,464
But one day...

705
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:39,200
The merchant became
a strict vegetarian.

706
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:42,970
He left his home and built
a small cabin in the woods,

707
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,806
because he felt sorry

708
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:49,076
for the thousands of foxes
hunters had killed for his furs.

709
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,213
And then
he disappeared completely.

710
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:58,719
When my sisters and i
wanted to scare each other,

711
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:02,890
the three of us lay
on the carpet in the dark.

712
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:05,893
And took turns telling...

713
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:10,831
How the man who was
once a rich furrier

714
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,935
now roams naked
through the forest.

715
01:16:13,937 --> 01:16:16,203
Maybe he has rabies?

716
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:19,106
Maybe he howls
bloodcurdling cries?

717
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:23,778
But anyone who meets the fox-man
in the forest at night...

718
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:27,848
His hair instantly
turns white in terror.

719
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,917
Excuse me. What is
that supposed to be?

720
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,253
An allegory?
An old-wives' tale?

721
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,525
Sorry.

722
01:16:37,527 --> 01:16:41,796
Don't be late for
school or work, boys.

723
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:50,638
What's the matter with you?
What's your problem?

724
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,175
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

725
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:39,086
Today I decided to invite
the two men in my life

726
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,589
to lunch at a restaurant.

727
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:43,824
Does dad know?

728
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,326
We'll surprise him.

729
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,261
Let's go to his office

730
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:50,331
and drag him out
like a moth from a book.

731
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,600
Come.

732
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,873
Today, you'll be my cavalier.

733
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:01,676
What's a cavalier?
A cavalier is a knight.

734
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,277
<i> Cheval</i> is French for horse,

735
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:05,846
and<i> chevalier</i> is
a knight on horseback.

736
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,696
Thank you.

737
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,039
Arieh.

738
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,282
Excuse me for a minute.

739
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:46,987
What happened?
Are my parents all right?

740
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,856
Your parents?
Is everyone all right?

741
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,925
Yes, everyone is fine.

742
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:52,660
We're surprising you.

743
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:54,662
We're taking you
out to lunch.

744
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,901
Sure. Why not?

745
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,038
Today I'm hosting,

746
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:07,141
and I'd love
if you ordered the most
expensive items on the menu.

747
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,918
Are you ready?

748
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,120
Yes.

749
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:20,688
Vegetable soup

750
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,790
and chicken with
mashed potatoes, please.

751
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,259
The same
for me, please.

752
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:30,064
Fania?

753
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:33,000
Fania?

754
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:38,806
Just some white rice, please.

755
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,441
And a cup of black coffee.

756
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,312
Thank you.

757
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:13,941
Fania?

758
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:18,145
Fania? Fanitchka?

759
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,156
Mummy, are you all right?

760
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,776
She needs total rest.

761
01:20:48,778 --> 01:20:50,945
I'll take care of it.

762
01:20:50,947 --> 01:20:52,446
Thank you, doctor.

763
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:15,035
These are the new pills.

764
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,374
They'll help you sleep.

765
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:26,146
Have some more water.

766
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,947
I don't know how to help you.

767
01:21:59,949 --> 01:22:02,182
I'm not your responsibility.

768
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:05,819
Fania, I don't know
how to help you.

769
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:10,524
Maybe I'll take you
to Tel Aviv

770
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:13,527
to be with your sisters
and get some fresh air.

771
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:19,266
Yes, fresh air.

772
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:32,246
It's not reparations. They can't
keep what they stole from us.

773
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:36,216
And we need the money
to absorb the survivors.

774
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:38,218
What are
you talking about?

775
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:42,623
It's blood money.
We can't sell them forgiveness.

776
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,298
A few days in Tel Aviv
and you'll be good as new.

777
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,601
No wonder you're miserable.
You live in Jerusalem.

778
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:59,306
We're going to pamper you.
All you have to do is rest.

779
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,544
Fania, maybe
you'll try some cake?

780
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,081
I'm not hungry.

781
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,949
You're not
eating at all.

782
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:10,651
You sound like mother.

783
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,681
The change of scenery
will do her good.

784
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:45,119
She's from Jerusalem.
She doesn't even know
what a beach is.

785
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:47,988
Summer here
would be too much.

786
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,257
It's true.

787
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,398
<i> That night,</i>
<i> the ayalon river</i>

788
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,333
<i> overflowed the banks</i>

789
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:04,104
<i> and flooded part of Tel Aviv.</i>

790
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:49,249
<i> My mother grew up</i>
<i> in an ethereal culture</i>
<i> of misted beauty</i>

791
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,718
<i> whose wings</i>
<i> were finally dashed</i>

792
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:57,491
<i> on the harsh Jerusalem stone,</i>
<i> hot and dusty.</i>

793
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:15,375
<i> Twenty years after completing</i>
<i> her studies in rovno,</i>

794
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:17,444
<i> that romantic schoolgirl</i>

795
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:21,715
<i> was confronted by daily life,</i>

796
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:26,253
<i> the heat waves,</i>
<i> poverty, and violence,</i>

797
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:29,123
<i> diapers, migraines,</i>

798
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:32,559
<i> ration lines, marriage.</i>

799
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:38,398
<i> The promise of her childhood</i>
<i> was trampled underfoot</i>

800
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,635
<i> and ridiculed by the monotony</i>
<i> of life itself.</i>

801
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:14,168
<i> Perhaps when life failed to</i>
<i>fill the promises of her youth,</i>

802
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:17,337
<i> my mother began</i>
<i> to envision death</i>

803
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:22,843
<i> as a protective,</i>
<i> soothing lover.</i>

804
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:34,748
<i> My version of her story</i>
<i> would have ended differently.</i>

805
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:05,712
<i> But it was her story to tell.</i>

806
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,225
Is your father home?

807
01:28:18,227 --> 01:28:20,727
There's a call from Tel Aviv.
It's urgent, please!

808
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:20,287
<i> A few years after</i>
<i> my mother's death,</i>

809
01:29:20,289 --> 01:29:25,459
<i> I left my father</i>
<i> and all of Jerusalem,</i>

810
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:27,728
<i> changed my name,</i>

811
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,597
<i> and went to</i>
<i> kibbutz hulda on my own.</i>

812
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,476
<i> My mother's dream,</i>

813

01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:48,014
<i> make the desert bloom,</i>

815
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:49,483
<i> pioneer.</i>

816
01:29:49,485 --> 01:29:50,917
Hello.

817
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:52,652
Amos?

818
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,759
Hello!

819
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,796
You're taller than me!

820
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,583
Can you hand me
my suitcase, please?

821
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:27,754
Thank you.

822
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,610
<i> Though I forced myself to</i>

823
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:54,881

827

<i> They all knew perfectly well,</i>

830

<i> hopeful and</i>
<i> not disappointing,</i>

833

834
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:47,534
<i> A fulfilled dream</i>
<i> is a disappointing dream.</i>

835

<i> This disappointment</i>
