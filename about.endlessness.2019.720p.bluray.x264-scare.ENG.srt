00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,909
ABOUT ENDLESSNESS

2
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,592
It's September already.

3
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,072
Mm...

4
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,230
I saw a man...

5
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,038
...who wanted to surprise his wife
with a nice dinner.

6
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,990
I need to tell you something.

7
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,432
When I walked up
these stairs last Friday...

8
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,356
someone was walking behind me.

9
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,797
I turned around

10
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,598
and realised it was Sverker Olsson.

11
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,112
An old schoolmate I haven't seen in...

12
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,358
well, years.

13
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,118
So I said "Hi, Sverker.
It's been a long time."

14
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,120
"How are things?"

15
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,710
He didn't answer.

16
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,994
He just walked by without saying a word.

17
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,796
Then I realised why.

18
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,553
I'd hurt him once, badly.
And he hadn't forgotten.

19
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,390
Oh, hi, Sverker.

20
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,518
It's been a long time.

21
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,993
I saw a man...

22
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,957
...with his mind elsewhere.

23
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,194
I saw a woman,
a communications manager,

24
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,874
incapable of feeling shame.

25
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,196
I saw a man...

26
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,234
...who did not trust banks...

27
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,436
<i>...and so he kept his savings
in his mattress.</i>

28
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:04,631
Crucify! Crucify!

29
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,160
Getup!

30
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,637
Get up, you scumbag!

31
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,156
Crucify! Crucify!

32
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,189
What have I done wrong?

33
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,239
What have I done wrong?

34
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,672
Stand up!

35
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,912
Come on!

36
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,955
Come on!

37
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:39,235
Crucify! Crucify!

38
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,073
Crucify! Crucify!

39
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,073
They drove nails through my hands.

40
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,394
What now?

41
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,591
It's gone now.

42
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,038
They drove nails through my hands.

43
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,434
'Saw a young man...

44
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,276
<i>...who had not yet found love.</i>

45
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,831
There's nothing strange
about having nightmares.

46
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,112
We all have them sometimes.

47
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,915
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

48
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I've had many patients with
all kinds of nightmares.

49
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,755
But I don't think
I've encountered this one before.

50
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,272
Not the most pleasant dream,
I must say.

51
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,630
No...

52
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:53,030
And recurring too, I understand?

53
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,912
Yes.

54
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,871
You are obviously burdened by something.

55
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,752
Any idea what might have triggered it?

56
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,918
Yes...

57
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,434
It was when I began losing faith.
Faith in the existence of God.

58
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,158
Oh my.

59
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,910
You're a priest, right?

60
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,876
Yes, it's my livelihood.

61
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,029
It's my job to preach about God.

62
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,115
Without believing in what you're saying.

63
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,631
That's not a pleasant situation,
I must say.

64
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,195
No...

65
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,111
But... could it be...

66
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,029
...God doesn't actually exist?

67
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,520
No, that would be terrible.
What's there to believe in then?

68
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,154
Damned if I know.

69
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,912
Maybe be content with being alive.

70
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,079
That's how I look at it.

71
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,718
We will try to help you with your troubles.

72
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,837
But as I'm sure you already know,
I don't work for free.

73
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,873
And neither do you, right?

74
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,434
No...

75
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,753
I suggest we meet one week from now.

76
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,999
Same time, here at my office.

77
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,277
Ingrid has all your information.

78
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,078
As I said, I suggest we meet here,
one week from now,

79
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,716
and help you with this.

80
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,718
And I would like to thank you
for coming here.

81
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,914
Ingrid will see you out.

82
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,315
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

83
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,153
I saw a man...

84
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,830
...who had stepped on a landmine...

85
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,430
<i>...and lost his legs.</i>

86
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,677
And it made him very sad.

87
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,594
Over here.

88
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,949
Wave to grandma.

89
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,072
Up you go!

90
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,431
Hello!

91
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,350
Wave to grandma.

92
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,793
My God, my God!

93
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,354
Why have you forsaken me?

94
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,192
Why have you forsaken me?

95
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,356
The body of Christ
broken for you.

96
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,397
The blood of Christ
shed for you.

97
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
The body of Christ
broken for you.

98
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,399
The blood of Christ
shed for you.

99
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,673
I saw a man...

100
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,509
...who had lost his faith.

101
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,191
The body of Christ
broken for you.

102
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,553
The blood of Christ
shed for you.

103
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,233
The body of Christ
broken for you.

104
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,230
The blood of Christ
shed for you.

105
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,839
'Saw two parents...

106
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,229
...who had lost their son in a war.

107
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,519
Tommy, dearest.

108
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,679
Dad is just fetching some water.

109
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,077
He'll be right back.

110
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,393
We're making the plot look nice
for you, Tommy.

111
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,958
You should know that, Tommy.

112
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,239
We're always making it look nice.

113
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,830
So you don't have to be embarrassed.

114
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,556
We're thinking of you, every day.

115
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,277
Yes, Tommy. Mommy's darling. We do.

116
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,280
Yes, we do.

117
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,230
! saw a couple,

118
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,910
two lovers...

119
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,670
...floating above a city,

120
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,831
renowned for its beauty,
but now in ruins.

121
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,550
- There! Daddy!
- Hi honey. Hi!

122
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,073
I've missed you so.

123
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,838
I saw a woman...

124
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,194
...who thought
no one was waiting for her.

125
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,920
I saw a woman...

126
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,998
...who loved champagne.

127
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,637
So much. So much.

128
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,716
Pardon me, is your name
possibly Lisa Larsson?

129
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,798
No, I'm sorry.

130
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,878
I saw a man...

131
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,118
...who had lost his way.

132
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,634
No.

133
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,112
No.

134
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,599
- Please...

135
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,635
No, no, no, no...

136
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,637
- No.
- Not

137
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,115
No...

138
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,312
Please, please...

139
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,719
Please. No, no, no.

140
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,990
No. Please...

141
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:47,433
No! No, no, no!

142
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,318
Please. No, no, no...

143
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,073
I saw a man...

144
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,032
...begging for his life.

145
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,276
Please. No.

146
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,231
No...

147
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,515
No! No! No!

148
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,992
Please...

149
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,759
Come on, guys!

150
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,758
I saw a woman...

151
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,432
...who had problems with her shoe.

152
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,671
I saw a man...

153
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,316
...who wanted to protect
his family's honour...

154
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,671
...and changed his mind.

155
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,952
I could see the two of you
had a lot to talk about.

156
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,190
No, what?

157
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,393
I could see the two of you
had a lot to talk about!

158
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,956
Calm down! Calm down!

159
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,317
You do know that I love you?

160
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,671
Yes dear, I know. I know.

161
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,519
You do know that I love you?

162
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,632
I know, I know.

163
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,996
The first law of thermodynamics...

164
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,954
...states that...

165
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,835
...everything is energy...

166
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,435
...and it can never be destroyed.

167
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,755
It is endless.

168
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,669
It can only change...

169
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,918
from one form to another.

170
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,279
That means...

171
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,109
...you are energy,

172
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,553
I am energy.

173
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,870
And that your energy...

174
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,200
...and my energy...

175
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,790
...can never cease to exist.

176
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,510
It can only transform...

177
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,917
...into something new.

178
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,429
Theoretically our energies...

179
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,390
...can meet again...

180
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,155
...in millions of years.

181
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,630
And then,
maybe you're a potato...

182
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,673
...or a tomato.

183
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,911
Then I'd rather be a tomato.

184
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,840
I saw a man...

185
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,080
who wanted to conquer the world...

186
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,318
and realised he would fail.

187
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,359
Sieg Heil!

188
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,674
I don't know what I want.

189
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,314
Excuse me?

190
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,673
I don't know what I want.

191
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,597
I don't know what I want.

192
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,510
I don't know what I want.

193
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,359
Poor bastard.

194
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,676
What?
You're not allowed to be sad anymore?

195
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,317
Of course. But why can't he be sad
at home instead?

196
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,671
Why here?

197
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,271
I saw a man
with his daughter...

198
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,633
...on their way to a birthday party.

199
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,199
And it rained.
It rained a lot.

200
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,518
Hello!

201
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,639
What should I do now
that I have lost my faith?

202
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,197
I'm sorry,
but we're just about to close.

203
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,670
What should I do now
that I have lost my faith?

204
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,836
I have to talk to doctor Lindh.

205
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,911
That's not possible. We're just about
to close and doctor Lindh is going home.

206
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,680
Please.

207
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,797
Hello.

208
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,918
What should I do now
that I have lost my faith?

209
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,998
I'm sorry, but we're closing now.

210
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,875
And you have an appointment next week.

211
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,034
I have a bus to catch.

212
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,757
I'm sorry, but I have to catch my bus.

213
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,999
What should I do now
that I have lost my faith?

214
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,031
Well, we're closing now.

215
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,680
We're closing the office, so...

216
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,680
- What should I do?
- You can talk about it next week.

217
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,873
- No, no...
- I have to ask you to leave now.

218
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,635
What should I do...

219
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,957
I have a bus to catch.

220
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,674
What should I do...

221
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,030
No...

222
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,996
No...

223
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,670
What should I do now
that I have lost my faith?

224
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,752
What should! do...

225
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,909
- I'd better not miss my bus.
- He'll probably leave soon.

226
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,750
What should I do now
that I have lost my faith?

227
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,877
Pardon me.

228
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,155
- Torbjom.
- Hasse.

229
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,997
- I understand you've got a toothache.
- Yes.

230
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,351
Well, that's no laughing matter.

231
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,910
Open wide.

232
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,117
Ow, ow!

233
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,516
That's the one causing you grief.

234
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,714
- I think we need some local anesthesia.
- No, no. I'm so scared of needles.

235
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,954
We'll have to make do without then.

236
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,155
Ow!

237
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,514
Ow!

238
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,359
Ow!

239
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,399
Goodbye.

240
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:08,239
My sincere apologies.
The doctor is in a bad mood today.

241
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,389
He's got problems.

242
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,790
Oh, really?

243
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,320
Isn't it quite fantastic?

244
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,953
Isn't it quite fantastic?

245
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,631
What?

246
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,353
Everything.

247
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,232
Everything.

248
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,115
Everything is fantastic.

249
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,436
Well, yes.

250
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:19,309
- I think so, at least.
- Alright.

251
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,599
I think so, at least.

252
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,354
I think so, at least.

253
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,591
Okay, then.

254
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:47,677
<i>I saw a defeated army...</i>

255
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,920
...marching to the prison camps...

256
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,953
...in Siberia.

257
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,391
Well, hello.

258
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,518
I guess you're getting tired of hearing
about Sverker Olsson again.

259
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,635
My old mate from school I ran into

260
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,639
a few weeks back.

261
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:31,357
This Friday it happened again.

262
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,672
And he didn't say hello this time either.

263
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:41,392
- What's he up to these days?
- I wouldn't know.

264
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:46,270
But I hear he got himself
a PhD, somehow.

265
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,749
He certainly wasn't too bright in school.

266
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,239
But now he's got his degree.
And that's more than I've got.

267
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,593
But dear,
you've done so many other things.

268
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,917
I'm not so sure about that.

269
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,079
I think time is rushing by,
and I haven't accomplished anything.

270
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,350
Now you're exaggerating.

271
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:19,392
- We traveled, and saw Niagara Falls.
- Yeah, yeah.

272
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:25,112
- And the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
- Well, yes.

273
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,871
And last year you climbed
the stairs of the Eiffel Tower

274
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,879
with your bad knee.

275
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,359
I'm sure Sverker Olsson
has been there too.

276
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,516
I can't believe a loser like
Sverker Olsson got a PhD.

277
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,679
It's really quite annoying.

278
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,838
But why do you keep dwelling on that?

279
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,270
It's annoying.

280
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,438
- It's annoying.
- Yeah, yeah.

281
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,314
I saw a man...

282
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,879
...who had problems with his car.
